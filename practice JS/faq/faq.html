        <h2><img src="images/add.png" width="24px" alt=""> What is Javascript</h2>
        <div class="close">
            <p>
                Javascript often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms 
                to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time 
                compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, 
                prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
            </p>

        <h2><img src="images/add.png" width="24px" alt=""> Why JavaScript?</h2>
        <div class="close">
            <p>
                Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.
                JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications.
                The vast majority of websites use it for client-side page behavior, and all major web browsers 
                have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.

        <h2> <img src="images/add.png" width="24px" alt="">About JS </h2>
        <div class="close">
            <p>
                JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but they are now embedded in some servers,
                usually via Node.js. They are also embedded in a variety of applications created with frameworks such as 
                Electron and Cordova. Although there are similarities between JavaScript and Java, including language name, 
                syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.
